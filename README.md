## 📌 Project Overview
Help International is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that aims to provide foreign aid to countries in need.  
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning (clustering)** techniques to classify countries into **three categories** based on socio-economic and health indicators:

- **0: Not a priority**  
- **1: Requires foreign aid**  
- **2: Do NOT require foreign aid**

By grouping countries into these clusters, the organization can make **data-driven decisions** in allocating resources effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to identify clusters of countries according to their socio-economic development and health status, enabling **Help International** to prioritize which nations should receive aid.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, etc.)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit** – Model building & interaction  

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Handling missing values, scaling features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding patterns and trends.  
3. **Feature Selection** – Identifying key indicators (e.g., GDP, health expenditure, trade).  
4. **Clustering** – Applying algorithms (K-Means) to group countries.  
5. **Evaluation & Interpretation** – Assigning cluster labels as:  
   - `0: Not a priority`  
   - `1: Requires foreign aid`  
   - `2: Do NOT require foreign aid`  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Countries were successfully clustered into **three meaningful groups**:
  - **Cluster 0:** Not a priority for aid.  
  - **Cluster 1:** Countries that require urgent foreign aid.  
  - **Cluster 2:** Countries that do not require foreign aid.  

This classification helps the NGO focus its **funding, planning, and outreach** efforts strategically.
